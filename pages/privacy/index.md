# Privacy

> Tabula exists to improve the college experience of SEAS students at Harvard. We will never sell, share or otherwise transmit your data to third parties.

## What we collect
The only data we require is your `@college` email address. Everything else you choose to give us is optional, but will obviously improve your experience.

## Security
None of the information you share beyond your email address can be linked to your identity. When you authenticate with Tabula we generate a unique token, which is then hashed so that we're able to associate your account with your past grades, academic interests, etc while your session is active... but not at any other time. This token is never persisted (i.e. is only stored in-memory for the duration of your session). If anyone were to gain access to our DB, they'd see a bunch of email addresses and course data... but they'd have no way to link it back to you or any other user. (And for that matter, neither do we.)

## What we do with your data
The data we collect is used to predict the experience you're likely to have with classes you haven't taken yet. We're interested in asking questions like "what grade is this person likely to receive," or "how much is this person likely to enjoy the class." We use data associated with your profile, as well as models trained on aggregate data from other students.

## Any questions / concerns?
