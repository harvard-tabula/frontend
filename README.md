### Getting up to speed

We highly recommend reading 

* https://medium.freecodecamp.com/you-might-not-need-react-router-38673620f3d#.i818ofeqo and https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate/blob/master/docs/routing-and-navigation.md to get up to speed on routing
* http://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/ to get a feel for what the CSS framework we're using offers
* https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/ to understand how we're utilizing Cloudflare to get free SSL hosting with a custom domain
* Following Dan Abramov's advice and learning React itself, then npm, JS bundlers, ES6, routing, flux in order.
* Reading the Webpack documentation https://webpack.js.org/concepts/ if you're unfamiliar with it. 
* Reading the Redux documentation http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ if you're unfamiliar with it. The "Advanced" example will give a high level overview of our Redux setup
* Understanding redux-thunk documentation https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk with special emphasize on asynchronous actions Promises
* Understanding fetch from isomorphic-fetch https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch. Used to make API requests

### Getting Started

**Step 1**. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or newer installed on your
machine.

**Step 2**. Install dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

**Step 2**. Compile and launch your app by running:

```shell
$ node run                      # Same as `npm start` or `node run start`
```

You can also test your app in release (production) mode by running `node run start --release` or
with HMR and React Hot Loader disabled by running `node run start --no-hmr`. The app should become
available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).


### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ npm run lint                  # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ npm run test                  # Run unit tests. Or, `npm run test:watch`
```


### How to Deploy

```shell
$ node run publish              # Build and publish the website to your gh-pages branch, same as `npm run publish`
```

If you need just to build the project without publishing it, run:

```shell
$ node run build                # Or, `node run build --release` for production build
```
